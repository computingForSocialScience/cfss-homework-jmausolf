# FLASK WEB APP

This application creates a locally hosted website that highlights several elements of my work on collecting presidential speech data from the White House, Office of the Press Secretary.

This FLASK App was designed to run on MAC OSX running an Anaconda version of Python. Other systems may not fully work.

This app includes several elements such as a locally run Ipython notebook segment and a MySQL database. Some elements may need to be adjusted on your local system, such as the MySQL password. The default password in this app is empty. Password = "".

In addition, the local app is in dialog with several external websites such as GitHub, Dropbox, and a live website hosted by Wix featuring many of these elements.


# To Launch

* From your terminal, navigate to the folder App.
* Type the following:

* $python launch_ipython.py
* $python app.py

Your local Flask app should now be running.
