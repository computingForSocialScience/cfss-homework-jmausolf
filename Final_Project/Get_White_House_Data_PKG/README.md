# Welcome to the README for Get-White-House-Data PKG

# Overview

This package utilizes both Python and Shell scripts to create a unique text file for every speech and remark from the White House:

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-and-remarks

This generates, logs, and sorts the unique URLs for every speech and remark by different parties, chiefly, the President, Vice President, First Lady, Second Lady, as well as other members of the executive staff.

To use, simply get pull this repository. Then use the terminal to naviage to Shell_Command folder. 

To collect every speech, in your terminal, simply type the following:

*	$bash RUN2.sh

The rest will be automated. Note: This package was written on a Mac OSX system using an Anaconda version of Python. 

Running "bash RUN2.sh" will run the entire program, collecting all speeches from 2009-2015. Once all individual speeches are run, the program executes a self cleanup, reorganizing the files so that the result is a polished file system.
